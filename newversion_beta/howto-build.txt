Building pyffmpeg on Linux
--------------------------

All you need to build it on Linux is the ffmpeg, and libswcale library installed.

Then all you need to do it run those two commands and you're done:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install



Building pyffmpeg on Windows
----------------------------

Building on Windows is slighly more complex. We're going to ffmpeg and pyffmpeg using MinGW and MSYS.

The following are instruction from a post I made at (http://www.gooli.org/blog/building-ffmpeg-for-windows-with-msys-and-mingw/).

We’ll start with downloading some tools of the trade and the source for ffmpeg.

   1. Download MinGW from here.
   2. Download MSYS from here.
   3. Download updated bash for MSYS from here.
   4. Get the latest snapshot of ffmpeg from here (here’s a direct link).

Let’s install the tools.

   1. Install MinGW (choose “MinGW base tools” and “MinGW make”) into c:\mingw
   2. Install MSYS into c:\msys\1.0
   3. After MSYS installation it will run a postinstall script. It will ask you some questions which you should answer as following:

      Do you wish to continue with the post install? [yn ] -> y
      Do you have MinGW installed? [yn ] -> y
      Where is your MinGW installation? -> C:\mingw

   4. Copy bash-2.05b-MSYS.tar.bz2 to c:\msys\1.0 and extract it (bash.exe should go into C:\MSYS\1.0\bin).
      We need to do this because ffmpeg’s configure script doesn’t work with bash 2.0.4 that comes with MSYS.
   5. Extract the ffmpeg sources. I’ll assume you’ve extracted them to c:\work\ffmpeg

Now it’s time to build the library.

   1. Create a file called myconfig in c:\work\ffmpeg and copy the following into it:

      #!/bin/sh
      ./configure -–extra-cflags="--mno-cygwin --mms-bitfields" -–extra-ldflags="-Wl,-–add-stdcall-alias" -–enable-memalign-hack -–enable-mingw32 -–enable-shared -–disable-static

   2. Run c:\msys\1.0\msys.bat. Run the following commands in the shell that starts:

      $ cd /c/work/ffmpeg
      $ ./myconfig
      $ make


Now that you've got ffmpeg and its libraries compiled, all that remains in building pyffmpeg. Still in MSYS's terminal, run the following commands:

      $ cd /c/work/pyffmpeg
      $ python setup.py build
      $ python setup.py install

You might need to edit the setup.py script and change the value of the WIN32_FFMPEG_BASE_DIR variable to the place where you put ffmpeg.
